                The first time I saw you, <span class="highlight">Maya</span>, was in the college canteen. You were sitting there, and I was playing table tennis nearby 🏓. When I caught a glimpse of you, I couldn’t help but think, “<span class="highlight">Wow, she’s beautiful 😍.</span>” But back then, I had decided not to get into a relationship, so I convinced myself not to talk to you. (*Famous last words, right?*)
                <br><br>
                A few days later, the college announced the Momothon program, and I wanted to get involved—to socialize more and make new friends 🤝. So, I decided to volunteer for the event. During the meeting for volunteers, I saw you again. My heart skipped a beat when you picked the role I secretly wanted—the one where you’d blow the whistle to signal time for the competitors 🕒. (*Let’s be honest, I just wanted to hear you whistle.*)
                <br><br>
                Then came the day we had to make banners for the event 🎨. I had no clue how to design one, so I asked a friend for help. She couldn’t, but she pointed me to you. When you came over to help, I felt butterflies in my stomach for the first time 🦋. (*Fun fact: Those butterflies still haven’t left.*)
                <br><br>
                The Momothon event was <span class="highlight">unforgettable</span>. We worked side by side, laughed, talked, and enjoyed every moment together 😄. (*Even though we never got our volunteering certificates, I think we earned something better.*)
                <br><br>
                Not long after, the college organized an orientation program at Diamond Hill Resort ⛱️. I decided I wanted to talk to you more during that trip. That night, we sat together on a swing, and you told me what kind of guy you liked. To my surprise, 80% of what you described matched me 😂. (*The other 20%? Clearly, a work in progress.*)
                <br><br>
                The next day, as we traveled back from the orientation, I sat next to you on the bus 🚌. When you fell asleep on my shoulder, I felt a kind of happiness I had never felt before 🥹. In that moment, I knew—I wanted you in my life, no matter what 💪.
                <br><br>
                After the orientation, life went on. You were studying hotel management 🍽️, and I was in IT 💻, so we didn’t get to see each other often, but we talked online all the time 💬. Slowly, our connection grew stronger. Finally, on August 10, 2024, at exactly 10:10 PM (*classic us*), I gathered all my courage and <span class="highlight">proposed to you 💍.</span> When you said yes, my heart felt like it was going to burst with joy 🥰. (*Spoiler alert: It still does.*)
                <br><br>
                Maya, thank you for choosing me when you had so many options 💕. You’ve brought a happiness into my life that I didn’t even know was possible 🌟. From the first moment I saw you, my world has been brighter, and my smile has been different because of you 😊.
                <br><br>
                I <span class="highlight">love you</span> so, so much, Maya ❤️. Thank you for coming into my life and making it so beautiful 🥰. I feel like we’re truly made for each other, and I’ll forever cherish every moment with you 👫.
